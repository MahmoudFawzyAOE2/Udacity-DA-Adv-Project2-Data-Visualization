# San Francisco Bay Bike-sharing System Visualization
## by Mahmoud Fawzy


## Dataset

> This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area in February 2019. You can find the raw data [here](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/October/5f91cf38_201902-fordgobike-tripdata/201902-fordgobike-tripdata.csv) .


## Summary of Findings

> i've disscussed relations depending on one, two, or three variables and here is some of the Conclusions in the main file:

The distribution of Trip Duration was normal the distribution of user age was right-skewed.

There were unusual points in the user age column (above 75).

The subscribers use the system periodically and for the same specific trips (that's why they subscribe to the service)


## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focused on the effect of the user types on the Duration .
I start by introducing the univariant plots alone like Gender, Age , User type ,....
I used mainly bar plots to make it obvious and clear.

Afterwards, I moved to the bivariant plots.
I used the violin plots of Duration with both Gender and User type.
so I can make clarify the important details and statistics like mode, median, and percintiles .

Then we covered the Multivariant plot of the hours, day of week, and , using Heatmap.
I've made sure to use a good color palette for the heatmap
to make sure the difference between each user type is clear.
